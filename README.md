## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

   - Or download ChromeDriver manually and add to PATH

2. **Login fails**
   - Check username/password
   - Try logging in manually first to handle any security checks
   - Instagram may require 2FA or additional verification

3. **No reels found**
   - Ensure the target profile exists and is public
   - Check if the profile has any reels posted
   - Try with a different profile

4. **Download failures**
   - Check internet connection
   - Reduce parallel downloads if experiencing issues
   - Some videos may be protected or unavailable

### Performance Tips

- **Optimal parallel downloads**: 3-5 threads work best for most systems
- **Video limits**: Set reasonable limits for large profiles
- **Output directory**: Use local drives for better performance
- **System resources**: Close other applications if experiencing slowdowns

## Dependencies

- **selenium**: Web automation and browser control
